<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>You aim and fire the cannon by touching the screen – the cannon then aims at the touched point and fires the cannonball in a straight line in that direction.
    The game begins with a 10-second time limit displayed on the screen. Each time you destroy a target, a 3-second time bonus is added to the remaining time, and each time you hit the blocker, a 2-second time penalty is subtracted from the remaining time. If all targets are destroyed before you run out of time, you win – otherwise, you lose.</p>

<p>There are five different difficulty levels. In each level, the number of target pieces is twice of the number of the level, and the speed of the target and the blocker increase as the level goes up.</p>

<p>A target hit will increase the user’s score by 10 × the current level. A blocker hit will decrease the score by 15 × the current level</p>
